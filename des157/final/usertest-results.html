                    <h2>Questions for User Testing</h2>
                    <p>1. Play five rounds to test out the game.</p>
                    <p>2. Interact with both Roll Again and Pass buttons.</p>
                    <p>3. Adjust the screen window size while playing.</p>

                    <h2>User Test 1</h2>
                    <p>For this user test, the user was not initially familiar with rules to the Game of Pig and started the game without knowing them. I wanted to test and see how different levels of prior experience with this kind of game would be with the user’s gameplay or experience with this version of the game. This being said, this user was unsure of the objective of the game until the fourth or fifth round, in which they guessed that the goal was to be the first to pass 30 points. As a quick side note, they mentioned that the accompanying sounds were very fitting and made the game more fun. Though they found the interface easy-to-understand and simple, as it was spacey and free of clutter, not knowing the rules was a constant obstacle that impacted their game gameplay as it took up the majority of their focus.</p>

                    <h2>User Test 2</h2>
                    <p>Unlike the last user, this user is familiar with the idea of the Game of Pig and is aware that there are different versions of this kind of game. The user was much faster in finishing the five rounds in comparison to the previous user, and with prior knowledge of this game’s instructions, they had more time to observe other features of the game. For instance, they had some observation in regards to adjusting the screen window’s size: when the screen expanded by a lot, there was a lot of empty space, but it worked well with the theme of the galactic theme of the game, but once the screen was very small, some graphics in the middle would overlap and mess made the interface seem more jumbled, which is definitely something to consider if I want this game to be more accessible.</p>

                    <h2>User Test 3</h2>
                    <p>This user is similar to the first user as they did not know the rules of the game beforehand, but this time, the user was given a set of instructions -- the one provided to the class during the early development stages of building the game as a studio project. This was done to test the effectiveness of these rules, and I wanted to see if they were clear enough for the user to understand and play the game on their own without any confusion. Fortunately, it seems like the given instructions were sufficient enough for a new user to understand. However, something that they pointed out was that the “scoreboard” or areas above the players that presented their score seemed a bit empty and almost out-of-place, which is something I could improve on.</p>

                    <h2>Plans to Update</h2>
                    <p>With the feedback that I received from these users, I plan on improving my game’s interface’s adaptability and certain features’ visibility. I hope to add access to a set of instructions somewhere, such as in an overlay, in case the user had no prior knowledge or experience with this kind of game before. I would also like to work on how some div elements are stylized by potentially adjusting how they are sized and positioned in relation to the window’s size. Furthermore, I am always looking for ways to make gameplay more fun and interesting, so I may incorporate more animations into the interface as well.</p>
