                    <h2>The Not-so Dreaded Popup Window: Practices for Improving Overlays</h2>
                    <time>Jan 28 2021</time>
                    <p>Overlays and lightboxes were first deemed as the “elegant solution to a tricky interaction-design challenge” of 
                        displaying important information without affecting the main screen’s content, as stated in the article <a href=
                        "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">“Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes”</a>. 
                        However, the constant misuse of this UI pattern has trained users’ initial response to “instinctively and automatically 
                        dismiss these windows” as stated by the article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">
                        “Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows”</a>.</p>
                    <p>Though the opportunity to add an overlay may arise, whether or not it is necessary to include is an important factor 
                        to consider — for instance, what action does the user need to perform (i.e. “view content, complete a form, make a decision”, 
                        etc.)? If so, from what I have gathered, one should aim to create a display-responsive overlay with a lightbox effect that is user-initiated, 
                        clearly states its purpose, and has a visible escape route. The size and location of the window must be able adjust between mobile and desktop 
                        screen sizes in order to keep the page’s content well-orientated without blocking access towards any other content, and giving the user access 
                        and control over the window allows for a better overall experience.</p>
                    <p>As someone who is always online, whether it be attending classes over zoom or browsing the web in my free time, I agree and feel as though 
                        popup windows have developed a negative connotation, as they are sometimes styled as untimely interruptions rather than important reminders. 
                        Now, from the developer’s perspective, these articles helped me better understand why we feel this way towards this feature, what exactly makes 
                        a popup window inefficient, and what practices I consider and in mind as I develop my own studio projects.</p>

                    <h2>Boosting Usability in Form Design</h2>
                    <time>Jan 22 2021</time>
                    <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">“Best practices for form design”</a> 
                        opened my eyes on how one can create an efficient and accessible online form and demonstrated how implementing or changing 
                        the smallest details can make a noticeable difference. </p>
                    <p>Aiming for a streamlined minimized interface by “minimizing the input fields” and using a “one column layout” 
                        proves to boost the usability of a form, but something else that I discovered while reading these tips is how 
                        less is not always more. For instance, inline labels and dropdown menus can save space on a webpage, but these 
                        features may hide away essential information and can potentially result in more taps/clicks from the user, so 
                        they are not always recommended. Also, as someone constantly struggles with choosing names or setting labels, 
                        learning about the “action buttons” was very helpful for me. This concept states that the label of a button 
                        should complete the statement “I want to”, such as “Book Ticket” and “Create Account”, and using this active 
                        voice on interactive buttons can make the entire user experience much more effective.</p>
                    <p>Though I have filled out many online forms, I never realized how important certain features were in contributing 
                        to its overall usability, and moving forward, I will definitely take this article’s tips into consideration when 
                        integrating online forms and creating user interfaces in the future.</p>
