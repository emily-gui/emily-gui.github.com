                    <h2>Usability in Form Design</h2>
                    <time>Jan 22 2021</time>
                    <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">“Best practices for form design”</a> 
                        opened my eyes on how one can create an efficient and accessible online form and demonstrated how implementing or changing 
                        the smallest details can make a noticeable difference. </p>
                    <p>Aiming for a streamlined minimized interface by “minimizing the input fields” and using a “one column layout” 
                        proves to boost the usability of a form, but something else that I discovered while reading these tips is how 
                        less is not always more. For instance, inline labels and dropdown menus can save space on a webpage, but these 
                        features may hide away essential information and can potentially result in more taps/clicks from the user, so 
                        they are not always recommended. Also, as someone constantly struggles with choosing names or setting labels, 
                        learning about the “action buttons” was very helpful for me. This concept states that the label of a button 
                        should complete the statement “I want to”, such as “Book Ticket” and “Create Account”, and using this active 
                        voice on interactive buttons can make the entire user experience much more effective.</p>
                    <p>Though I have filled out many online forms, I never realized how important certain features were in contributing 
                        to its overall usability, and moving forward, I will definitely take this article’s tips into consideration when 
                        integrating online forms and creating user interfaces in the future.</p>
