                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p>For my final project, I will revamp my Game of PIG by building a stronger aesthetic or theme and incorporating more interesting interactions and animations to create an unique and interesting user experience.</p>

                    <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
                    <p>This website <a href="http://www.playonlinedicegames.com/pig">Pig Dice Game Online</a> shares the same base game as mine, so I was curious to see how this website further developed this game’s concept and what kind of features it added to its interface. The interface seems to be split in three vertical sections: the left section is where you click on the action buttons, the middle section states whose turn it is and announces the winner, and the right section lists the rules and instructions to the game. Though some parts of the interface could be improved — for instance, the dice roll skipped in and out of the screen so quickly that it was very difficult to actually see what number was rolled — I thought it was very clever to have the second player be the computer itself to give the solo player a chance to play this game.</p>

                    <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
                    <p>This website <a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/piggame.html">The Game of Pig</a> also demonstrates another version of this game. The interface of this website seems similar to the prior comparison in that it is also split into three sections, but this time, horizontally: the top section is where the game is actively played, the middle section allows the user to adjust the speed and difficulty, and the bottom section covers the instructions. I thought the animation of the dice was very clever as the di shakes every time the roll button is hit, fading into a different number of dots like a magic trick. Though the middle section provides users a chance to customize their gaming experience, the options provided seem unclear. For instance, there is a slider labelled Computer Turn that I, as a user, am unsure of what that exactly changes in the game.</p>

                    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                    <p>I want to bring my game to the next level by elevating its graphics and incorporating more interactive features into the game. Similar to the websites I compared above, I would like to find a way to make the second player the CPU itself so that the user has the chance to play a true game by themselves. I am inspired by the dice animations that both websites used, triggered by the roll button, so I hope to develop an animation for the dice images. Also, I love story-telling, so I plan on further developing my theme for this game or creating a story to better explain the current state of my game’s interface.</p>

                    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                    <p>To create a more immersive experience, I hope to adjust the overall color palette of my game’s interface to potentially be more dark and ominous. Though I used a flurry of colors for my first iteration, I would like to try a more monochromatic, dramatic color combination to create a different, maybe even more serious, tone to this game. I would also like to incorporate more animations into the interface, such as making the globe that holds the dice glow and making the dice float within the globe. I think that the game could also be more informative by including instructions in case the user does not know how the game works in the first place.</p>

                    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                    <p>To make this more fun and interactive, I plan on placing a huge emphasis on improving the animations and interactions in this game. For time-based behaviors, I would like to make the globe that encompasses the dice to be subtly and consistently glowing in the background, and I am interested in making the players standing on the marbled planets on the left and right bottom corners of the screen to possibly react to the dice results as well. I also wanted to make the winning announcement more noticeable and dramatic by creating a popup overlay for it, accompanied with a congratulatory sound and animated graphic, and the user will be able to start a new game by clicking on a button from this window.</p>

                    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                    <p>Overall, I hope to make this experience fun and immersive for the audience by making this game’s interface more interactive and the theme more developed and interesting. With more animations and features added into the game, I hope that the user will have a more fulfilling experience while playing this game. To achieve this, I plan on going back to the pen to resketch my ideas out on paper before programming them into my website. I sometimes find myself dreaming too big and being disappointed with my inability to transfer my ideas out onto the screen, so I hope that if I can carefully plan out exactly what I want beforehand, then I will hopefully be able to execute and present something incredible.</p>
